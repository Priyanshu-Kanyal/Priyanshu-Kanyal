## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a developer who loves building things that make life easier and smarter. Whether it’s a **family expense tracker** that keeps budgets in check or a **population predictor** that turns raw data into insight, I aim to craft projects that are practical, scalable, and enjoyable to use.  

I’m driven by curiosity, a bit of perfectionism, and a whole lot of coffee. When I’m not debugging code, I’m usually mentoring peers, hosting coding contests, or exploring how AI and cloud tech can transform the way we live.
